          I led the establishment of Vessi’s design language for the new apparel and accessories categories, 
          unifying the brand’s expression while increasing the assortment by 133%. Based on the brand’s 
          ties to water and playfulness, I used fluidity and repetition as guiding design principles to 
          recreate Vessi’s visual identity, which was launched alongside a rebrand in 2025.

          My role within this project included category design direction and apparel design, 
          collaborating closely with product development to bring the concept and collections to life.
